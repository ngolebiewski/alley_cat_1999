A demo of an Alley Cat bike messenger style racing game. In the future: BRPG a bicycle role playing game! Making this demo as part of the Ebitengine 2025 Holiday Hack 2025 Game jam for an idea that I've had for a while.

My idea for the process is to make the art first, and then code the game.

Thanks!
-Nick

## What is an Alley Cat?

A bike messenger style race through the streets of a city, through regular traffic. You get a manifest, a list of checkpoints to stop at and get marked as completing, much like a messenger has to choose the best route to drop off the packages at the addresses they have. It tests skill at the best bike riding, and the best route choosing skills...

## Why 1999

Because Taxis looked cooler, there was no Google Maps or smart phones, but there were Nextel (R TM Copyright) Walkie Talkie phones, there were hardle bike lanes, and the World Trade Center was still there. 

Idea for the future to jump years and decades to the present time.

## Tech

* ART: All art is made by the human behind this game, Nick. No AI at all is allowed. This round will be ASEPRITE for the pixel art, although in the future I may hand-draw and scan.
* CODE: Will use AI for an assist as needed. I am an artist first I suppose.
* MUSIC: Will use AI for coding help, and will write songs on a guitar first, I want them all to be generated by a system synth rather than be a wav or mp3 etc. 

### To be continued...

### Build for WASM the Web early on to make sure it works, before game is complete. See as you go
https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/webassembly.html

1. env GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o alley_cat_1999.wasm github.com/ngolebiewski/alley_cat_1999
2. cp $(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js

That works -- but a better way for when this is deplyed on Netlify is to make a netlify.toml and have Netlify do the WASM build, and then clear out the wasm files from our own repo.

### Build for Mac OS locally
`go build -o ~/Desktop/alley_cat_1999`

### Build the .exe for windows
env GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/win/alleycat1999_win.exe .

### and Linux
env GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o build/linux/alleycat1999_linux .

**Notes:**
- 1/4/2026: Minimal shell of game runs on Netlify (title and scene changes)! [alleycat1999.netlify.app](https://alleycat1999.netlify.app/)

**First Go at the Sprite Sheet**
- 16x16 tiles, but I think I will need to have a 32x32 world and will x2.
- WAY to bright. Will either convert to grayscale and recolor or add in a shader on top.

# DEVELOPMENT LOG

## Jan 8, 2026 @ 4:49PM

3 days and change left to go!

Currently: I have a basic scene manager, 1 animate bicyclist, and an in progress spritesheet! Plus, some mobile/touch and WASM/web sort of set up.

So MUCH to do! Nice to look at what is essential.

Thursday:
Goals:
- Finish 'world' -> that is all the buildings and the street for the race to take place on
- Stretch: Placeholder Music -> Get some sound in there. And a few sound effects too. Build an off/on in settings -- actually, need settings! new scene from title? can access from race?

Notes:
Note: I broke out a ukelele to come up with the bass line, and then described it to chat GPT, its a start at least!

While working on the spritesheet I somehow deleted a layer, saved the file, and then thought I lost hours of work! Luckily I was tracking the asesprite files in github, and recovered most of it that way. I don't think I lost a single tile, just the layout with them put together.

World, not close to finished. Music, there's some music. Ideally we'd have a cut scene to a Discman where the biker can change CDs and what music plays! First up, lets get some art up and have the biker ride in the city, but not over buildings!!!


Friday:
- Entities and collisions -> Freestyle bike around the streets. Get some pedestrians and cars moving around.
- Create Manifest/location check in system!!

Saturday: 

misc.

Hazards:
- Car doors opening
- Cars
- Steam Barrels

I spent most of the day wrapping up sprites to make a tilesheet in Asesprite and then making a tilemap in Tiled, and getting that to parse into a game.
Camera, collissions with blocking layers on the edge, and it is nearly midnight.

REFOCUS
1. Need a playable game!
2. GOAL: Get the best time for completing all the checkpoints and getting to the finish.
    - START
    - END
3. OBSTACLES:
    a. Other Bicyclists in the Race
    b. Taxis - right now the only cars on the road. 
4. MECHANICS
    a. Manifest (the list of checkpoints)
    b. record list
    c. mini map
    d. Overlay to see manifest
    e. Place to check in 
        - Load in some people sprites
    f. Speech
5. Sound effects.
    a. Car horn, trigger when bike cuts in front of car
    b. Steam
    c. mumbly sound for when people talk
5. Start cut scene for NYC with twin towers and some clouds parallax...

- Added in a 'level' scene title in between the game title and the bike race environment scene. A lot of duplication between scenes, so there should be a title_scene interface in the future. Also switched the key pressed to just key pressed so 'one' click wouldn't skip over the NYC title scene so quickly you can't even see it as a mere human. 
    - NYC title todo: pixel art of NYC with twin towers and some clouds over new york harbor and some parallax movemenet. There needs to be an orange Staten Island Ferry to set the scene. 
    - Note: to add in an image, its relative location goes into 'embed.go' and then added to th Assets struct and then into the LoadAssets function to make it available.
    - TODO: get all the titles in one spritesheet and just select a sub image from that. 
---

- IDEA/TODO => implement a system to abstract what the next scene to load is. Kind of like updading a linked list now.

- Moving 'devlog' content into readme, and then deleting this file.

---

🚕 The taxi update/tilemap Spawn object layer

- Swap out tilemap for the test version, much smaller
- Set up a manifest scene, although it doesn't have content yet,
but does have a spin animation!
- Thinking that as the deadline is tomorrow, may make it a 1 checkpoint
as finish line sort of race for the time being
- TAXIS
- set up a taxi manager and taxi entity
- spawn points and direction loaded in from Tiled
- the up car is bringing in one of the incorrect tiles
TODO
- Collisions, right now the car and player don't interact
- Traffic awareness to act more like a traffic automotan
- Eventually: stop at red lights. move up and down on roadway

Oh, the WASM doesn't work on an iPad browser! No virtual joystick! 
Add in a check for macintosh and multitouch to trigger it. 
Also, when starting the game initially, if you're in the start title scene, and your interaction is TOUCH to trigger the next scene, then toggle on the isMobile flag to make sure that the joystick pops up. At least in theory.

*BUGS*
- When hit by a car can get bumped over a building, and then get stuck there!
- ~~up/down taxi sprites won't display, something weird with grabbing tile 32!~~

---
 🚖 vertical taxi sprite fix, B mobile, cash

 - Set up a Vertical taxi, the function to grab the tiles wasn't working
 in a vertical context. the bottom of the car was a traffic light! 
 - Still, will limit vertical taxis until a traffic light scenario
 is encoded

 -💵 added cash to the player struct and pass to the 
 heads up display. will gain cash on wins, and lose cash
 when paying for hospital visits

 -🎮 B button wasn't working on touch screens, attempting a fix and
 pushing to check

 ---

Getting the Checkpoints up and running is wild, I feel like the game is really coming together.

 Converted an m4a audio file to ffmpeg -i 2026-01-11_09-56-01.m4a the-reveal.ogg
 guitar by Matt. However don't have time to get it in before the jam is due.

Ok, time to take out what is isn't working: NPC bikers!
Finesse the game over scenes and put some instructions in.
Maybe a few sounds for the end scenes.
Submit to itch!
