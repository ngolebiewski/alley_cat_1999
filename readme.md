# Alley Cat 1999

A demo of an Alley Cat bike messenger style racing game. In the future: BRPG a bicycle role playing game! Making this demo as part of the Ebitengine 2025 Holiday Jam for an idea that I've had for a while.

My idea for the process is to make the art first, and then code the game.

## What is an Alley Cat?

A bike messenger style race through the streets of a city, through regular traffic. You get a manifest, a list of checkpoints to stop at and get marked as completing, much like a messenger has to choose the best route to drop off the packages at the addresses they have. It tests skill at the best bike riding, and the best route choosing skills...

## Why 1999

Because Taxis looked cooler, there was no Google Maps or smart phones, but there were Nextel (R TM Copyright) Walkie Talkie phones, there were hardle bike lanes, and the World Trade Center was still there. 

Idea for the future to jump years and decades to the present time.

## Tech

* ART: All art is made by the human behind this game, Nick. No AI at all is allowed. This round will be ASEPRITE for the pixel art, although in the future I may hand-draw and scan.
* CODE: Will use AI for an assist as needed. I am an artist first I suppose.
* MUSIC: Will use AI for coding help, and will write songs on a guitar first, I want them all to be generated by a system synth rather than be a wav or mp3 etc.
