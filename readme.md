# Alley Cat 1999

**For Ebitengine 2025 Holiday Hack 2025 Game Jam**

A demo of an Alley Cat bike messenger style racing game. In the future: BRPG a bicycle role playing game! Making this demo as part of the Ebitengine 2025 Holiday Hack 2025 Game jam for an idea that I've had for a while.

My idea for the process is to make the art first, and then code the game.

## What is an Alley Cat?

A bike messenger style race through the streets of a city, through regular traffic. You get a manifest, a list of checkpoints to stop at and get marked as completing, much like a messenger has to choose the best route to drop off the packages at the addresses they have. It tests skill at the best bike riding, and the best route choosing skills...

## Why 1999

Because Taxis looked cooler, there was no Google Maps or smart phones, but there were Nextel (R TM Copyright) Walkie Talkie phones, there were hardle bike lanes, and the World Trade Center was still there. 

Idea for the future to jump years and decades to the present time.

## Tech

* ART: All art is made by the human behind this game, Nick. No AI at all is allowed. This round will be ASEPRITE for the pixel art, although in the future I may hand-draw and scan.
* CODE: Will use AI for an assist as needed. I am an artist first I suppose.
* MUSIC: Will use AI for coding help, and will write songs on a guitar first, I want them all to be generated by a system synth rather than be a wav or mp3 etc. 

### To be continued...

### Build for WASM the Web early on to make sure it works, before game is complete. See as you go
https://ebitengine.org/en/documents/webassembly.html

1. env GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o alley_cat_1999.wasm github.com/ngolebiewski/alley_cat_1999
2. cp $(go env GOROOT)/lib/wasm/wasm_exec.js

That works -- but a better way for when this is deplyed on Netlify is to make a netlify.toml and have Netlify do the WASM build, and then clear out the wasm files from our own repo.

**Notes:**
- 1/4/2026: Minimal shell of game runs on Netlify (title and scene changes)! [alleycat1999.netlify.app](https://alleycat1999.netlify.app/)

**First Go at the Sprite Sheet**
- 16x16 tiles, but I think I will need to have a 32x32 world and will x2.
- WAY to bright. Will either convert to grayscale and recolor or add in a shader on top.
