3 days and change left to go!

Currently: I have a basic scene manager, 1 animate bicyclist, and an in progress spritesheet! Plus, some mobile/touch and WASM/web sort of set up.

So MUCH to do! Nice to look at what is essential.

Thursday:
Goals:
- Finish 'world' -> that is all the buildings and the street for the race to take place on
- Stretch: Placeholder Music -> Get some sound in there. And a few sound effects too. Build an off/on in settings -- actually, need settings! new scene from title? can access from race?

Notes:
Note: I broke out a ukelele to come up with the bass line, and then described it to chat GPT, its a start at least!

While working on the spritesheet I somehow deleted a layer, saved the file, and then thought I lost hours of work! Luckily I was tracking the asesprite files in github, and recovered most of it that way. I don't think I lost a single tile, just the layout with them put together.

World, not close to finished. Music, there's some music. Ideally we'd have a cut scene to a Discman where the biker can change CDs and what music plays! First up, lets get some art up and have the biker ride in the city, but not over buildings!!!


Friday:
- Entities and collisions -> Freestyle bike around the streets. Get some pedestrians and cars moving around.
- Create Manifest/location check in system!!

Saturday: 

misc.

Hazards:
- Car doors opening
- Cars
- Steam Barrels

I spent most of the day wrapping up sprites to make a tilesheet in Asesprite and then making a tilemap in Tiled, and getting that to parse into a game.
Camera, collissions with blocking layers on the edge, and it is nearly midnight.
