3 days and change left to go!

Currently: I have a basic scene manager, 1 animate bicyclist, and an in progress spritesheet! Plus, some mobile/touch and WASM/web sort of set up.

So MUCH to do! Nice to look at what is essential.

Thursday:
- Finish 'world' -> that is all the buildings and the street for the race to take place on
- Stretch: Placeholder Music -> Get some sound in there. And a few sound effects too. Build an off/on in settings -- actually, need settings! new scene from title? can access from race?
* Note: I broke out a ukelele to come up with the bass line, and then described it to chat GPT, its a start at least! *

Friday:
- Entities and collisions -> Freestyle bike around the streets. Get some pedestrians and cars moving around.
- Create Manifest/location check in system!!

Saturday: 



misc.

Hazards:
- Car doors opening
- Cars
- Steam Barrels
